1.
Read a natural number n. Test whether it is palindromic

2.
Read a string consisting of 𝑛 strictly positive real numbers (𝑛≥2), representing the course exchange rate RON/EURO for 𝑛 consecutive days.Display the days
between which the most the largest increase in the exchange rate and the amount of the increase. For example, for 𝑛=6 days and the exchange rate given by the
string 4.25,4.05,4.25,4.48,4.30,4.40, the largest increase of was RON 0.23 between days 3 and 4.

3.
A craftsman has to pave the entire floor of a rectangular kitchen of size 𝐿1×𝐿2 centimetres, with square tiles, all of the same size. Knowing that the master
builder does not want to cut any tiles and wants to use a number minimum number of tiles, determine the size of the tiles he needs, such as and their number.
For example, if 𝐿1=440 cm and 𝐿2=280 cm, then the craftsman needs 77 tiles tiles, each with a side of 40 cm.

print(y)

4.
Read a number n and a string of n natural numbers. Show the smallest and the largest number in the string (using a minimum number of comparison operations)

max=x
n-=1
while n>0:
    x=int(input("Enter number in string:"))
    if min<x:
        min=x
    if max>x:
        max=x
    n-=1
print(max,min)

5.
Read nine natural numbers a and b. Display the lowest Fibonacci number in the interval [a,b].

n=a
x=0
y=1
while(n<=b):
    if n==0:
        print(n)
    else:
        z=x+y
        while z<=n:

            z=x+y
    n=n+1
    
6.   
A natural number 𝑛 is read. Display the smallest and the largest number that can be formed from the digits of 𝑛. For example, for 𝑛=812383 you need the 
numbers 883321 and 123388 are displayed.

n=int(input("Enter the number n:"))
p=1
x=y=0
numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
for i in numbers:
    z=n
    while z>0:
        if z%10==i:
            x=z%10*p+x
            p=p*10

        z=z//10
print(x,y)

7.
Check if a given number from the keyboard is perfectly square.

    #variant 1 with sqrt
x=int(input())
import math #new scale to look up all math functions
if math.sqrt(x).is_integer(): #data type float(class) has method x.is_integer()
    print("This is a perfect square")
else:
    print("Not a perfect square").

    #variant 2 with sqrt
x=int(input())
from math import sqrt #It will be used without being prefixed by the mode name ( !! just sqrt)
if sqrt(x).is_integer():
    print("This is perfect square")
else:
    print("Not a perfect square")

    #variant without sqrt
x=int(input())
if int(x**0.5)==x**0.5:
    print("It is a perfect square")
else:
    print("Not a perfect square")

8.
Read two natural numbers a and b with no more than two digits. Show all positive natural numbers of at most two digits that divide by 5 and are not in the 
range [a,b] (the numbers will be displayed on the same line, ordered ascending, then descending).

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
for i in range(a):
    if i%5==0:
        print(i,end=" ")

    if i%5==0:
        print(i,end=" ")
    i=i+1
i=99
while i>b:
    if i%5==0:
        print(i,end=" ")

        print(i,end=" ")
        
9.
Read a string of n >1 numbers. Display the number of values of type hill (greater than neighbouring elements; the first and last elements in the string have
only one neighbour)

n=int(input())
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
n=n-2
c=0
if x>y:

numbers as terms. Is there always such a decomposition?

n=int(input())
print(f"{n}=",end="")

Read a natural number n. Test whether it is palindromic

n=int(input("Enter the number:"))
x=0
y=n
while n>0:
    x=x*10+n%10
    n=n//10
if x==y:
    print("Palindrom number")
else:
    print("No palindrome number")


Read a string consisting of 𝑛 strictly positive real numbers (𝑛≥2), representing the course exchange rate RON/EURO for 𝑛 consecutive days.Display the days
between which the most the largest increase in the exchange rate and the amount of the increase. For example, for 𝑛=6 days and the exchange rate given by the
string 4.25,4.05,4.25,4.48,4.30,4.40, the largest increase of was RON 0.23 between days 3 and 4.

n=int(input("Enter number:"))
y=z=b=a=0
day=1
while n>0:
    x=float(input("Exchange rate:"))
    if x>y:
        z=x-y
        y=x
    if x<y:
        z=y-x
        y=x
    if b>0:
        if a<z:
            a=z
            zi=zi+1
    n=n-1
    b=b+1
print(a, "RON", "on days",day, "and",day+1)


A craftsman has to pave the entire floor of a rectangular kitchen of size 𝐿1×𝐿2 centimetres, with square tiles, all of the same size. Knowing that the master
builder does not want to cut any tiles and wants to use a number minimum number of tiles, determine the size of the tiles he needs, such as and their number.
For example, if 𝐿1=440 cm and 𝐿2=280 cm, then the craftsman needs 77 tiles tiles, each with a side of 40 cm.

n=int(input("Enter L1:"))
m=int(input("Insert L2:"))
x=n*m
y=x//1600
print(y)


Read a number n and a string of n natural numbers. Show the smallest and the largest number in the string (using a minimum number of comparison operations)

n=int(input("Enter number:"))
min=0
x=int(input("Enter the number in the string:"))
max=x
n-=1
while n>0:
    x=int(input("Enter number in string:"))
    if min<x:
        min=x
    if max>x:
        max=x
    n-=1
print(max,min)


Read nine natural numbers a and b. Display the lowest Fibonacci number in the interval [a,b].

a=int(input("Enter the number a:"))
b=int(input("Enter the number b:"))
n=a
x=0
y=1
while(n<=b):
    if n==0:
        print(n)
    else:
        z=x+y
        while z<=n:
            x=y
            y=z
            if n==z:
                print(n)
                n=b
            z=x+y
    n=n+1
    
    
A natural number 𝑛 is read. Display the smallest and the largest number that can be formed from the digits of 𝑛. For example, for 𝑛=812383 you need the 
numbers 883321 and 123388 are displayed.

n=int(input("Enter the number n:"))
p=1
x=y=0
numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
for i in numbers:
    z=n
    while z>0:
        if z%10==i:
            x=z%10*p+x
            p=p*10
            y=y*10+z%10
        z=z//10
print(x,y)
